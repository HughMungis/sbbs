Olodrin's Orphanage is an IGM for Lord 5.00 JS by Underminer

About:
------
Olodrin's Orphanage is simple in scope - it allows players to Adopt(Buy), or Give Up for Adoption(Sell) children.
There is also the option to try and catch feral children in the wild, but bad things can happen if you miss.
Finally, there is an option to trade children for a Horse.

All costs scale with a player's level in order to try to avoid abuse by high level players.
