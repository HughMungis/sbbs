n4hy Synchronet Minesweeper Help n

The classic game, revisited for this Synchronet BBS!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)

The object of the game is to uncover all safe cells without uncovering
(detonating) any mines (rhën)!

hControlsn:

* Move the cell selector h< >n around the game board using the arrow keys,
  home/end/page-up/down or the numeric keypad (i.e. for diagonal movement).
  
* Uncover a cell (reveal its contents) using the 'R' key or the space-bar. 
  If you reveal a mine (rhën), sorry: you lose, game over, try again!
  If you reveal an empty cell, then all adjacent empty cells will also be
  uncovered (a depth-first search algorithm popular in coding interviews)!
  Uncovered cells with a mine in any surrounding/adjacent cells will have the
  total number of adjacent mines (a digit, from 1 to 8) displayed.
  These digits are your clue where the next mine or empty cell may be located.
  When all empty cells are uncovered, the game is won!

* Flag a covered cell as having a suspected mine with the 'F' key. When the
  game is over, incorrectly-flagged cells are marked with '!', but don't count
  against you. 

* Display a list of previous game-winners with the 'W' key.

* Start a new game with the the 'N' key. A new difficulty level may be chosen.
  Larger user terminals can support larger game boards for greater challenges!

* Quit the game with the 'Q' key.

If some of the navigation keys (e.g. arrow keys, home, end) do not work for
your terminal, you can try using these alternatives:
  * Up Arrow: Ctrl-^
  * Down Arrow: Ctrl-J
  * Left Arrow: Ctrl-]
  * Right Arrow: Ctrl-F
  * Home: Ctrl-B
  * End: Ctrl-E
  * Page-Up: Ctrl-P
  * Page-Down: Ctrl-N
  
... or use the numeric keypad.
